Initial Project Proposal:   

 
Our project is a comprehensive project management system that addresses the common pain points faced by software development teams, including missed deadlines, budget overruns, and poor quality. The system should provide a centralized platform for project planning, execution, and tracking, and should be designed with the specific needs of software development projects in mind.  
There will be three levels of users: admins, project managers, and team members. The application will allow managers to assign team members to teams; create and assign teams and members tasks; create bug and issue tickets that can be accepted, worked on, and checked before approving the changes; track progress of tasks and overall project; and allow for communication between teams and team members. 
 
 
World Assumptions: 
What we know is true when it comes to our application, a user would assume that our app is used to just make and list tasks for deadlines, but it also can be used to also issue tickets and to be able to collaborate with other team members. People will take this for granted but it is quite essential for what we are doing with this application. 
 
User Requirements: 
Project Planning: The system should provide tools for creating project plans, including setting project objectives, defining tasks, and assigning resources. 
Project Execution: The system should allow teams to track progress, update project plans in real-time, and collaborate on tasks. 
Project Tracking: The system should provide real-time reporting and analytics on project progress, budgets, and quality, and should allow teams to identify and address issues as they arise. 
Collaboration: The system should facilitate effective communication and collaboration between teams and team members. 
Security: The system should be secure, with robust access controls and data protection measures in place. 
 
Specifications and Interface Needs: 
For our application to be able to function some specifications and interface needs that our app will need to include is an ability to be able to  
 
Program: 
The program will hopefully be able to build a foundation in which users can be able to set up communications between teams, set up ways for our users to be able to initiate tickets, and to be able to organize the tasks that are needed to be done with whatever they desire to do. 
 
Hardware: 
The hardware that is required for our system to be operational at an exceptional rate includes a dedicated server in which we can manage to give the best servers to our clients for them not to have any problems related with our app and to also include great security for our app with robust data protection measures for our clients.
